I am a board-certified emergency physician, Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Medicine, and Simulation Director for the Duke Emergency Medicine residency. My work sits at the intersection of frontline emergency care, medical education, and performance assessment.

In addition to academic and educational roles, I provide independent expert review and consultation related to emergency medicine practice, supervision, and training—translating complex clinical decisions into clear, defensible explanations for legal, educational, and institutional contexts.
