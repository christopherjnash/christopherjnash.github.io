I am a board-certified emergency medicine physician and Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Medicine, where I serve as Simulation Director for the Duke Emergency Medicine residency. I work clinically at Duke University Hospital and Duke Raleigh Hospital.

My clinical practice includes high-acuity emergency care, and my academic work focuses on simulation, assessment, and medical education research. I completed a Master of Education at Harvard, with scholarship centered on performance evaluation and the role of artificial intelligence in medical education.

Across clinical, educational, and consulting work, my goal is to make complex emergency medicine decisions understandable—whether for trainees, educators, legal professionals, or healthcare leaders.
